# LargeInt
LargeInt is a C++ library for handling arbitrarily large integers with custom bit sizes. It supports standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and bit shifting, while managing overflow and underflow. The library allows efficient handling of large numbers and can be used in standard expressions with any bit size.
